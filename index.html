              He has taught in a wide variety of settings, both in the classroom
              and as private instructor in the studio (currently at Watermelon

            <h4>Original Music</h4>
            <p>
              This Album showcases the guitar artistry of Jon Spivack in a
              variety of settings: from solo jazz guitar, to folk and blues
              duets to Latin trios. It may be described as chamber jazz or the
              music you might listen to as you savor a fine wine with that
              special someone. Some selections include flute,sax and/ or
              percussion. This is gentle instrumental music performed with
              focus, spirit and intensity; stimulating both sides of one's
              brain. State of the art recording and engineering also add to the
              total listening experience. So enjoy this music as you watch the
              sun set or as you cruise along a lonely desert highway.
