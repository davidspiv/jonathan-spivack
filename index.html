            <p>
              Jon Spivack is a parent, an educator, and a musician who has been
              teaching and performing in the Sacramento area for over 25 years.
              He has earned a B.A. in Biological Sciences and a Master of Arts
              in Special Education at California State University, Sacramento.
              Jon enjoys teaching and sharing his love and enthusiasm for music.
              He has taught in a wide variety of settings, both in the classroom
              and as private instructor in the studio (currently at Watermelon
              Music in Davis, Tim's Music in Sacramento and in The San Juan
              Unified School District). Jon also co-founded Learning Quest, a
              company that creates and markets educational materials for
              students. Of the four teaching credentials he has earned, Jon
              credits his Multiple Subject and Adult Ed credentials for his
              success as a teacher. His new Jazz/Folk/Blues CD, Branching Out,
              is now available on CD Baby.

            <h4>Original Music</h4>
            <p>
              This Album showcases the guitar artistry of Jon Spivack in a
              variety of settings: from solo jazz guitar, to folk and blues
              duets to Latin trios. It may be described as chamber jazz or the
              music you might listen to as you savor a fine wine with that
              special someone. Some selections include flute,sax and/ or
              percussion. This is gentle instrumental music performed with
              focus, spirit and intensity; stimulating both sides of one's
              brain. State of the art recording and engineering also add to the
              total listening experience. So enjoy this music as you watch the
              sun set or as you cruise along a lonely desert highway.
