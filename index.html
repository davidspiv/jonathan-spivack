          <p>
            Jon Spivack is a parent, an educator, and a musician who has been
            teaching and performing in the Sacramento area for over 25 years. He
            has earned a B.A. in Biological Sciences and a Master of Arts in
            Special Education at California State University, Sacramento. Jon
            enjoys teaching and sharing his love and enthusiasm for music. He
            has taught in a wide variety of settings, both in the classroom and
            as private instructor in the studio (currently at Watermelon Music
            in Davis, Tim's Music in Sacramento and in The San Juan Unified
            School District). Jon also co-founded Learning Quest, a company that
            creates and markets educational materials for students. Of the four
            teaching credentials he has earned, Jon credits his Multiple Subject
            and Adult Ed credentials for his success as a teacher. His new
            Jazz/Folk/Blues CD, Branching Out, is now available on CD Baby.

          <h4>Original Music</h4>
          <p>
            This Album showcases the guitar artistry of Jon Spivack in a variety
            of settings: from solo jazz guitar, to folk and blues duets to Latin
            trios. It may be described as chamber jazz or the music you might
            listen to as you savor a fine wine with that special someone. Some
            selections include flute,sax and/ or percussion. This is gentle
            instrumental music performed with focus, spirit and intensity;
            stimulating both sides of one's brain. State of the art recording
            and engineering also add to the total listening experience. So enjoy
            this music as you watch the sun set or as you cruise along a lonely
            desert highway.
